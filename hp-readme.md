Team formed: Helene (Team Lead), Ivan and I. We have decided on a 'Pinterest-type' app for our project.     

### Early Planning stages:      
We have set up a Trello board to manage workflow, established a main Repo and forked successfully to Team Members. This has been something of a learning curve - having been Team Lead on the previous group project I have had to get used to the extra steps required when forking!           

Early Wireframe completed and ERD started. Advice taken on how to relation our tables. At one stage, we were deciding between a three-table join table (User, Image, Board) and three join tables. Eventually we decided upon a single join table for Image-Board M-M and 1-M for User-Image and User-Board.
